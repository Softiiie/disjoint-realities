## About

This repository aims at creating a database full of diverse realities, stylistically and aesthetically inspired, influenced or even "forked" from the [SCP Foundation](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Structure

The Disjoint Realities are structured in a quite specific way:

&nbsp;

### Sets

First come the **Sets**.<br>
To help you understand and visualize them better, imagine an horizontal axis. On this axis are found an infinite amount of sets, next to each other, just like real numbers <!--($\R$)-->.

#### Perfect Void

Perfect Void can be visualized as the "zero" of the Sets' axis.<br>
As its name expresses, the Perfect Void is completely blank and de**void** of anything, unlike other sets on the axis.

#### Positive Sets

Positive Sets are found *after* the Perfect Void, according to the axis' direction.

#### Negative Sets

Negative Sets are found *before* the Perfect Void, according to the axis' direction.

&nbsp;

### Cells/Trees

Inside of every Set are found a finite amount of **Cells**, each containing one single **Tree**.<br>
Each Cell _**completely coincidentally**_ corresponds to each chemical element in the [Periodic Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_Table).<br>
Each Tree bears the name of the _**totally coincidental**_ chemical element of the Cell it is in.

&nbsp;

### Branches

Each Tree bears a varying amount of **Branches**.<br>
Branches do not possess leaves or any sort of variation, looking more like cones sticking out of the Trees' trunk than realistic branches, instead they possess **Spores** (*see next section*).<br>

&nbsp;

### Spores

**Spores** gravitate around Trees' Branches, just as [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron) gravitate around the [atomic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus).

&nbsp;

### Universes

**Universes** are to be taken in the [litteral sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe).

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

## Properties

From each **Structure element**'s variety of characteristics come variables, herein called **Alternatives**.

&nbsp;

### Alternatives

All Universes are of course not identical, hence why across them one may come across what can be called **Alternatives**<!-- NOT a reference to Mandela Catalogue! -->.<br>
Alternatives can be organized in an uncountable amount of manners, although here they will be split into several categories [~~that I totally did not take from Dwarf Fortress (and its wiki) down to the description kind of out of sloth~~](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Quest#Quest_log):

&nbsp;

#### Intrigue

Staples of the Universe's Canon(s), its main _"""storyline"""_.

&nbsp;

#### Events
<!-- Âµ MERGE WITH 'Intrigue'? -->

Events that are happening or have happened in the past.

&nbsp;

#### People

People and other historical figures.

&nbsp;

#### Bestiary

Creatures from around the world, along with their descriptions, where to find them, etc.

&nbsp;

#### Groups

Entities, including civilizations, site governments, etc.

&nbsp;

#### Regions

Regions of the world.

&nbsp;

#### Sites

Various sites around the world.

&nbsp;

#### Artifacts

Basically encompasses all objects and items ~~and I totally did not kept this section name because of Dwarf Fortress~~.

&nbsp;

## Chronology

Time is a very important factor in the Disjoint Realities:

&nbsp;

### Canons

A **Canon** is a storyline.<br>
It creates, removes, uses [...] properties (Alternatives...) and concepts in order to construct said storyline's chronology.

&nbsp;

### Timelines

A **Timeline** is a subsidiary unit to Canons.<br>
Unlike Canons, Timelines are a *spin* on the elements and their relation/interactions used in the Canon.

In the vast majority of time, Timelines will **not** create, remove, use [...] properties (Alternatives...) ; if they ever do, it is very often *de facto* as to avoid any discrepancy in the chronology/storyline.

<!--
### Canons/Timelines

All **Universes** follow a certain sequence of events, ultimately called a **Timeline** or a **Canon**.<br>
Several Canons can belong to a same universe, and of course, although Canons are often viewed at the scale of Universes, they of course affect the rest of the [Structure](#structure) (*eg.* other Universes, Trees, etc).
