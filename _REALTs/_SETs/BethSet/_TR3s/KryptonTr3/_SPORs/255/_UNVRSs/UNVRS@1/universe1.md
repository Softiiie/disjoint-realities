## Chronology

### Canons

### CAN-001: "Greedy Compiler"

Canon 1 (aka _**CAN-001:GreedComp**_) is the first Canon of Universe1.

In this Canon, **Jessie K.** is the creator and main contributor to the *Linux Project*, the famous FOSS Operating System, all the way until 1991.

In 1991 occurs the **Semicolon Incident**, in which Jessica forgets a semicolon, leading to an <!-- eotw scenario code --> End-of-The-World Scenario in which the compiler quite litterally overflows with stacks and destroys Universe 1.

&nbsp;

### CAN-002: "In Extremis"

In this Canon, *Jessie K.* has a different name: **Jessica A.**.

In this Canon, Jessica also works on the *Linux Project*, although here it is not about building an Operating System, but about studying quantum physics.

Throughout the development, the project's focus and aim change, and upon succeeding the final build, Jessica discovers the existence of different **Timelines** and **Universes**.

With this discovery comes the realization that among all timelines, Universe1's first Canon's Timeline ends in a Stack Overflow, leading to the death of the Universe. Unable to bear the thought of themselves dying in another timeline, they find a way - again via Linux - to contact **Jessica K.**, and warn them about the *Semicolon Incident* Reality-Anchor and the emergency for them to leave this Universe.

Jessica K. then leaves Universe1 for [Universe1](universe2.md), their arrival estimated to somehow be between the 1980s and the 2020s. Upon their arrival, they create an unknown cyber-terrorist group, who will go on and create *Linux 2: Hexadecimal Boogaloo*.
