**_Universe 18 : "Henri-Julien"_**, classified as `UNVRS-18:Henri-Julien` and commonly addressed as **_Universe18_** - **_Henri-Julien_**, is the `18`th Universe of the **Bore-TR3**, located at coordinates `(9;19;10)` of the **Bore-Universe-Grid**.

&nbsp;

The main *Alternative* of Universe18 is the presence of several *Universal Constants*, organized in a pyramidal system, excluding `UNVRS-CONST-4`, the **_Microwave_**, which acts more as a tool/third-party condition towards an `XK-Class` **End-of-the-World Scenario**.
