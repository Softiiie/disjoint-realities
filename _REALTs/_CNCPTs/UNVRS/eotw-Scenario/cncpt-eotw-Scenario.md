An **End-of-the-World Scenario** is an hypothetical situation of radical consequences on normality or reality, so much that it brings about an **"end-of-the-world"** (end of the world as we/the entities in said world know it).

While all End-of-the-World Scenarios lead to desastrous effects, the latter - as well as their causes - widely vary and as such, these Scenarios are to be categorized according to their individual variations.

## End-of-the-World Scenarios Classes

&nbsp;

### AK-Class - Madness

**Memetically spread behavior**.

Not necessarily apocalyptic as it can also simply reorient society around said behavior.

&nbsp;

### ADK-Class - Complete Anomalous Destabilization

Reclaiming of the Earth by the "Anomalous".

Typically occurring 1 to 3 years after an unspecified human extinction event or [**SK-Class Dominance Shift**](#sk-class---dominance-shift).

&nbsp;

### BI-Class - Before Invasion

Imminent occurrence of a **K-Class Scenario**, specifically an **invasion** from a foreign dimension.

&nbsp;

### CK-Class/RK-Class - Restructuring

**Change in reality** by a deity/reality bender/retrocausal altering of history/etc.

Can be so radical it brings about the end of the World, or can also be small "localized" changes.

&nbsp;

#### TK-Class - Causal Restructuring

Consequence of a drastic [**CK-Class**](#ck-classrk-class---restructuring) restructuring that resulted in the **breaking *then* repair of the timeline**, although that **repair is imperfect**, leaving incoherences, loose ends and the such.

&nbsp;

### EK-Class/MK-Class - End of Human Consciousness

**Total loss of human consciousness.**

&nbsp;

### GH-Class - Dead Greenhouse

Condition of **endangerment/extinction of the Human species** while **Earth remains inhabitable**.

&nbsp;

### HK-Class - Deific Subjugation

**Appearance of a deity** followed by its **annexing of power**/**authority**.

&nbsp;

### IK-Class - Collapse of Global Civilization

**Collapse** of Civilization.

&nbsp;

### LK-Class - Species transmutation scenario

**Alteration** of Humanity itself.

&nbsp;

### NK-Class - Grey Goo

*Hypothetical Scenario* in which **self-replicating nano-machines** malfunction and turn the entirety of the world into **ooze**.

Often used in the case of self-replicating entities able to cause **extensive contamination** to the planet.

&nbsp;

### PK-Class - All-In-One Existential Pandaemonium Event

Collapse of all *Hyporealities* into one same **meta-space** by an *Hyperreal Consciousness*, resulting in **total narrative collapse** from incomprehensibility and annihilation of consciousness.

&nbsp;

### QK-Class - Quantum Degeneracy

**Physics-based** end of the world.

&nbsp;

#### VK-Class - Localized Dimensional Collapse

**Physics-heavy** Scenario.

&nbsp;

### SK-Class - Dominance Shift

**Surpassing** of Humanity as a *dominant species* by **another** species or civilization, or *vice-versa*.

&nbsp;

### WK-Class - Mass Extinction Event

**Extinction** of *one* or *several* **non-human species**.

&nbsp;

### XK-Class - End-of-the-World

"General" **apocalyptic Scenario**.

*Religious* apocalypse, *destruction* of humanity, Earth, the universe, etc.

&nbsp;

### XK-Delta-Class Solar Singularity

> #### *XK-Δ-Class Solar Singularity*

Undergoing of a **"Solar Singularity" Event** by the Sun.

As a consequence of, *conversion* of **all living beings** coming into contact with its **emitted light** into **gelatinous entities** combining and blending with one another.

&nbsp;

### ZK-Class Reality Failure

**Fundamental breaking** or **elimination** of **reality**.

Usually a consequence of a *physics-based event* or an *entity* annihilating things by design.

&nbsp;

### THK-class Extradimensional Diplomatic Breakdown

> #### *ÞK-class Extradimensional Diplomatic Breakdown*

**Breakdown** of **diplomatic relations** with a powerful **extradimensional organization**.

<!--
 

### Lifted Veil/Broken Masquerade Scenario-->

&nbsp;

### CC-Class - Collapse of Chemistry

**Alteration** of the **Laws of Physics** in such a way that **chemistry** relying on **carbon-based elements** no longer provides conditions **suitable for life**.
